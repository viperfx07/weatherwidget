## Answer this
* A quick (1 page) description of your solution, outlining anything of interest about the code you have produced. This could be anything from why you chose the language and or libraries, why you structured the project the way that you did, why you chose a particular error handling strategy etc

## Assumptions
* Use the weather icon pack from OpenWeather which is different from the design provided

* A list of assumptions that you’ve made while putting this together. We’ve only given you a very loose spec, so you’ll probably need to fill in some blanks while you are working. If you note down the assumptions, for us, then we will be able review the code within the context of those assumptions
